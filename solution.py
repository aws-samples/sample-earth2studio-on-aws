"""AWS Solution identity: stack descriptions and SDK user-agent attribution.

Two independent reporting mechanisms read the same three values out of the
``solution`` block of ``solution-config.json``, so cutting a release means
editing one file and nothing else:

  1. **Deployment counting** keys off each deployed CloudFormation stack's
     ``Description``, which must carry the solution id — ``SO`` and digits —
     in parentheses:

         (<id>) - <solution name>. Version <version>

     ``stack_description()`` builds it (with a per-component variant for a
     multi-stack app). The CDK app is the only caller.

  2. **API usage attribution** keys off a suffix appended to the ``User-Agent``
     header of every AWS SDK call:

         AWSSOLUTION/<id>/<version>

     ``get_client()`` / ``get_resource()`` attach it, and every boto3 call site
     that runs from a checkout goes through them. Three files run detached,
     with no repo to import from, and so inline the token from the
     ``USER_AGENT_STRING`` environment variable instead:

         backend/handler.py                        (Lambda bundle: the deployed
                                                    asset is backend/ alone)
         sagemaker_deploy/model_code_fcn3/inference.py   (SageMaker container)
         sagemaker_deploy/model_code_dlwp/inference.py   (SageMaker container)

     The launchers inject it: stacks/ui_stack.py into the Lambda environment,
     sagemaker_deploy/deploy.py into the model container environment.

Neither resource tags nor any other mechanism feeds these two pipelines, so
there is deliberately nothing else here.

Why ``user_agent_extra`` and not ``AWS_SDK_UA_APP_ID``: botocore sanitises the
app-id value and rewrites ``/`` to ``-``, so the token would arrive as
``AWSSOLUTION-<id>-<version>`` and match nothing. ``user_agent_extra`` is
passed through verbatim. There is no environment variable or shared-config key
for ``user_agent_extra``, which is why plain ``aws`` CLI invocations cannot be
attributed at all — README.md ('Operational metrics') lists the calls in this
repo that are therefore uncovered.

Failure behaviour is deliberately asymmetric. A missing or malformed config
degrades attribution to "no suffix" — it must never break a running pipeline —
but makes ``stack_description()`` raise, because a stack that deploys with a
description silently lacking the id is counted as zero installs forever.
